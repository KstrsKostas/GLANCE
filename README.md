### This repository contains a variety of projects that I've been working on since my undergrad years. Their focus is on General Relativistic calculations regarding Black Hole/compact object imaging and the study of spacetimes in alternative theories of Gravity. The code is written in SageMath and Python and it has been used for my BSc (published) and MSc (submitted for publication) theses.
