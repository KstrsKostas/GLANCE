 This repository contains a variety of projects that I've been working on since my undergrad years. Their focus is on General Relativistic calculations regarding Black Hole/compact object imaging and the study of spacetimes in alternative theories of Gravity. The code is written in SageMath and Python and it has been used for my BSc ([published](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/ac7028/meta))and MSc (submitted for publication) theses. These projects are ongoing and will continue to be developed as an integral part of my PhD candidacy.
